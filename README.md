# Mixed Messagese
Hi, this is actually first time for me to make a project to post for other people to see.
This Mixed Message project will type a random message everytime you run the program. Please note that there are limited number of messages that I created, so you might find similer messages when you run the program repeatedly.

## How I created this program
It's very simple. I used VS code for text editor. After I made a folder for this project, I initiated git using the command line. After I made the first commit, I pushed the code to GitHub repository.
Then I started working on writing codes. There are three main parts here. First is an array that contains several messages. Second is a function where give random rumber that are less than the lenght of the arr, so we make sure that we don't get out of bond error. This function use this randomly generated number as an index to get the value from array.
Lastly, we just need to call the function to print it.
